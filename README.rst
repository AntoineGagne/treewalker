Installation
============

This library is available on `hex.pm <https://hex.pm/packages/treewalker>`_.
To install this library, simply add the following lines to your
``rebar.config``:

.. code-block:: erlang

    {treewalker, "0.1.0"}

Keep in mind that this library is not yet ready for production use since it is
missing many core features such as rate limiting.

Development
===========

Running all the tests and linters
---------------------------------

You can run all the tests and linters with the ``rebar3`` alias:

.. code-block:: sh

    rebar3 check
